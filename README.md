Cloud-Down
=========

Cloud-Down is a rails application that aims to make it easy to download music from the cloud. The software currently just works with Soundcloud, but the plan is to make it an open platform that anyone can add their own feeds to and subscribe to other peoples feeds.

Features
--------

Currently the app gets the latest 'hot-tracks' from Soundcloud, optionally filtered by genre, and lets you either stream them, or download them for listening to later.

The original concept is from [@redeye][redeye], this fork will build upon the foundation he has layed and add some new features for other sites and technologies.
